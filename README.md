# color-picker

## A color-picker web component ðŸŽ¨

Demo: [https://jsmithdev.github.io/color-picker/](https://jsmithdev.github.io/color-picker/)

I merged parts of the wonderful [FlexiColorPicker](https://github.com/DavidDurman/FlexiColorPicker) library into this component as I wanted zero dependencies for this web component

The demo (index.html file) shows how to import, get/set color, etc as you might irl

Feel free to open an issue for more info

## can install via npm

```npm i -S wc-color-picker```
