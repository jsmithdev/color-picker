# color-picker

## A color-picker web component ðŸŽ¨

Demo: todo gitpages link
Status: In Development

Using [FlexiColorPicker](https://github.com/DavidDurman/FlexiColorPicker)

- as of writing, the page level imports a modified version called cp.js on root of project that this uses

- when time, I'd like to proper fork FlexiColorPicker and use to either

  - make an es6 module & import it into color-picker, resulting in 2 files in the color-picker folder
  - combine all into 1 file in the color-picker folder
