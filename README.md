# color-picker

## A color-picker web component ðŸŽ¨

Demo: [https://jsmithdev.github.io/color-picker/](https://jsmithdev.github.io/color-picker/)

I merged the needed part of the wonderful [FlexiColorPicker](https://github.com/DavidDurman/FlexiColorPicker) library into this component

Check out the demo / index.html on how to import, get/set color, etc.

Feel free to open an issue for more info
